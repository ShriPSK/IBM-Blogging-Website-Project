                      <p>The idea of having Python as a first programming language has a rational background. First of all, the syntax of Python is short and clear and the underlying model of objects and variables working is perfectly consistent. That means you can write “real” and pretty powerful applications without great effort. So there is nothing strange that many schools teach students programming using Python.
<br><br>However, knowing two languages is always better than one. If you are thinking of learning a second language after Python, Java could be a really nice choice. In this article, we are going to discuss switching from Python to Java in the case of a beginner software developer.</p>
                  
                     <h5><b>Why Java?</b></h5>
  <p>There are lots of different popular languages such as C++, C#, JavaScript… and there are pros and cons in learning any of them. So why Java? Here are some thoughts.</p>
<p>Java is one of the most popular languages according to the most rankings. Hence, it is easy to find a good job.Java has industrial strength. It is used for large systems by large groups of people. Big companies need a lot of junior software developers. So it is beginner-friendly.</p>
<p>Java is a general-purpose language, you may use it for developing almost any types of programs. It has libraries for almost everything. Enterprise, Mobile, Big Data, Cloud Services, Software-defined networks (SDN) and many more.</p>
<p>The family of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) languages is very wide and diverse. It is not only Java but modern Groovy, Closure, and Kotlin. As well as Ruby and Python special versions — JRuby and Jython. If you know how to work with JVM with its native language Java, it is easier to work with the others. There is a somewhat probability that Groovy or Kotlin could happen to be the next big programming thing (but not soon).</p>

                      <h4><b>Switching to Java… What to do?</b></h4><br>
                      <img src="assets/images/pic.jpg" alt="">
                      <br><br><h5><b>1.Learn the basics of Java (Java Core)</b></h5>
                    
  
        <p>Javarevisited — it is a huge website with good articles, courses and interesting problems to solve.</p>
<p>Practical oriented course to learn Java — CodeGym. Learn Java on CodeGym means to solve a huge amount of coding tasks with fast automatic validation, tips, help and so on. Sure the lectures are also available, it is a complete course.

                    <h4><b>Before you start. “Progressive” Python vs “legacy” Java?</b></h4><br>

                 <br><br>   <img src="assets/images/pic2.png" alt="">
  
        <br><br><p>Java is a statically typed, while Python is dynamically typed. This is the main difference between the topic’s languages. Technically it means that in Python you create your variables and don’t define their type. Types are defined only at runtime and the only condition for not having a runtime bug is to support the operations you used to the variables. So, if we have two objects such as Bird and Dog and give them a command to move fast before we run the program they are both the same. However, if we did everything right at runtime first will fly and the second will run. In Java, the Dog “knows” that it is a dog before runtime because it was defined by a programmer. You write more in Java while your computer has less work.</p>

     <h4><b>The main difference: dynamically typed Python vs statically-typed Java<b></h4>
<p>Although the courses bring much value to those mastering Java programming, they can’t still compete with the official documentation in terms of efficiency. Java documentation is way challenging to read, yet it remains the most comprehensive resource. It is like a Bible for Java programmers. So, make sure to read the official documentation to better understand the language you learn.</p>
<h4><b>Interpreted Python and somewhat compiled Java<b></h4>
<p>Java is a compiled language and Python is interpreted. It is a simplification to say like this, however it is close to the truth.
  Anyway during the execution Python code is interpreted at runtime. Java code is compiled into bytecode of JVM at compile-time and JVM runs it.</p>

  <h5><b>Backward compatibility</b></h5>
<p>Usually, the evolution of a programming language involves backward compatibility. However, this does not apply fully to Python. Python 2 came about in 2000, and Python 3 hit the scene in 2008. They are more or less compatible but have enough differences in functionality and syntax, so that in principle they can be considered as different languages. Instead of modifying new trends and ideas in Python 2, Python 3 was conceived as a new language that somewhat used the experience of Python 2. The development of Python 2 continued separately, and its final implementation (version 2.7) will support only to 2020.</p>
<p>Java was created with keeping backward compatibility in mind. Is this good or bad? This approach has led to a huge legacy codebase. On the other hand, this ancient code can be gradually updated, and the risks that the “veteran” will not start in the modern environment in the case of Java are minimized.</p>
<h5><b>Speed of program executing</b></h5>
<P>In the case of Python, you do less, but the computer does more. In Java, everything is upside down compared to Python. So, because of all these statics and compilation instead of dynamic typing and interpretation, Java is working much faster. That means your Java program will execute in a shorter period of time and operations will work faster as well. It is not always a noticeable difference for the user. However, sometimes it could be critical. If you want to learn more differences, this infographic can also help</P>     
<h5><b>Conclusions</b></h5>  
<p>Professional software developers don’t always get to choose what tools to use. Times are changing the preferences of employers that may change along with them. The good news is that the tools are much more alike than they may seem. And Java is a good and powerful one even if after Python it seems too verbose.</p>
