They will not only teach you about design specifications but will also help you develop the vision to devise your own state of the art designs. Let’s look at them now.</p>
                     <h5><b>1.CSS in Depth</b></h5><br>

                    <img src="assets/images/c1.jpg" alt="">
  
        <p>Web developers must understand at least the basics of HTML and CSS. If you want to become an expert web developer, you’ve gotta know them through and through.
            Well, this book helps you learn the styling part of web development that is CSS. It offers in-depth and structured ways to use CSS to style your HTML elements.
            As I began reading this book, I discovered that it’s packed with creative examples and best practices of using CSS that will definitely sharpen your technical skills and inspire your sense of design.</p>
            <p>With state of the art examples and exercises, this book will definitely hon your CSS skills and take it to the next level. From the basics of design to advanced CSS design concepts, you will experience it all in your path to master the nooks and corners of CSS. The objective of this book is to make you a better web designer and make your web apps look spectacular.</p>
                      <h5><b>2. Enduring CSS</b></h5>

                    <img src="assets/images/c2.jpg" alt="">
  
        <br><br><p>The main objective of this book titled “Enduring CSS” is to make the web developers write the CSS style codes which are durable over a long period of time. It is a guide to writing style sheets for large scale, rapidly changing, long-lived web projects.</p>
<p>It taught me how to individualize the styles so that those CSS modules become simpler to transport into different contexts and projects. It imparts knowledge on CSS tools such as PostCSS and linting tools to study and maintain the CSS code base across the large project.
    This book also specifies how to handle states more accessibly with ARIA attributes as opposed to class changes. There is much more in-depth knowledge to explore in this book.

                    <h5><b>3. CSS Refactoring</b></h5><br>

                    <img src="assets/images/c3.jpg" alt="">
  
        <br><br><p>This book or a chapter of the book is mainly based on refactoring and scaling of the CSS codes. It imparts knowledge on what actually refactoring means and its relation to software architecture. According to the book “Refactoring is the process of rewriting code in order to make it more simple and reusable without changing its behavior “. Now, we know that CSS styles can be made re-usable as well by making an external stylesheet.</p>
<p>This book aims to help us re-write the design elements and attributes that are modular and scalable at the same time without changing their overall functions. It introduced me to best practices, examples, concepts of refactoring the CSS code and also performs a unit test on them. Overall, the book provides ample knowledge on how CSS works and how refactoring it will make the code more efficient, and scalable in the long run.</p>
     <h5><b>4. Atomic Design<b></h5>
<p>The Atomic Design book written by Brad Frost introduces techniques for designing our UIs as thoughtful hierarchies. This book also discusses the qualities of effective pattern libraries along with methods to transform the team’s design and development workflow.
    As a design concern, this Atomic design concept provided in this book divides the design components into different levels such as atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. They basically help to understand the singular most unit of designing called atom which when structured properly becomes a molecule.</p>

<h5><b>5. HTML & CSS (also jQuery one)<b></h5><br>
    <img src="assets/images/c4.png" alt="">
<p>This book is a full-fledged learning ground from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript including jQuery as well. It is an all-in-one book that offers a detailed understanding, concepts, practical examples, and best practices of HTML5, CSS3 including jQuery.

    <h5><b>6. GET READY FOR CSS GRID LAYOUT </b></h5><br>
    <img src="assets/images/c5.png" alt="">
<br><br><p>Well, the grid layouts were an important addition to design specifications. They made the positioning of the elements on the webpage easier. The webpage could be segmented into different grid areas where each grid areas have their own set of design elements.
    The grid areas could be positioned anywhere necessary to give an intuitive look to the overall UI. Now, if you want to dive deep into the pits of grid layout then this book by Rachel Andrew definitely does the job for you.
